$ apt install maven default-jdk default-jre openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre -y

# To generate a .EXE using launch4j are necessary the following packages
$ apt install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev lib32z1 lib32ncurses6 -y

# Clone this repository

## FAQ
> #### Why does the .EXE need java on target machine to run?
> The JRE is required and the executable will not work without it. Because the Windows need JRE for translating the program from java byte code to machine language.
